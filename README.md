## Task runner

Schedules and runs any script-based tasks. As an example, using this to clear my macOS desktop of files every friday at 5:45pm, by moving files to a "Drawer" directory.

#### Notes:

* To add task definition to `tasks.json`

* To following cron definition to your system (executes every 1 minute):
```
* * * * * sh  ~/work.sh
```
